				<h1>Welcome all you Product Hunters!</h1>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h1>***Many of you are still looking for growth hacks to rapidly grow your company. If that's you, read this:***</h1>
<br>
<p><strong>(The $100 product which could change your life, and you could get for free)</strong></p>
<br>
<p>I PROMISE this will be worth the three-minute read ⏰</p>
<br>
<p>You'll be able to growth hack without having to learn to code or spend months trying different things.</p>
<br>
<p>How would growth hacking the same way I have change the results of your company?</p>
<br>
<p>One reason I don't talk about hacks for Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Pinterest etc. is I have the definitive guides for them in my book/video course,</p> 
<br>
<h1>"Secret Sauce: A step-by-step guide to growth hacking".</h1>
<br>
<p>We wrote it (and created the video course) because there were no practical marketing guides for the web 3.0 age.</p>
<br>
<p>We wish we had this guide when we were starting out- When I was on welfare and Austen was living in his car trying to get his startup off the ground this would've been amazing!</p>
<br>
<p>Here's what we did wrong:</p>
<br>
<p>1) We didn't know which channels to work on</p>
<p>2) We didn't work out who our customers were fast enough</p>
<p>3) We didn't understand the basics of growth hacking</p>
<br>
<p>You don't have to go through what we did though!</p>
<br>
<p>Growth hacking is pretty simple once someone shows you how to do it.</p>
<br>
<p>It's not your fault if you don't know it yet- You have been fed awful information by "guru's" who want you to pay them $10,000 a month for coaching, so they never give any of their good information away for free in blog posts etc.</p>
<br>
<h1>If you could growth hack without having to hire expensive people, what would that mean for your business?</h1>
<br>
<p>When you're looking at daily spikes of traffic from Google Analytics, you're gonna feel like the god of the Interwebz.</p>
<br>
<p>It's an amazing feeling.</p>
<br>
<p>Over $125,000 in orders from growth hackers so far!</p>
<br>
<p>If you want to turn on new channels for users, traffic, or revenue, here's what a few of our early readers are saying about it:</p>
<br>
<p class="bigp"><blockquote>"I literally learned more by reading Secret Sauce for one hour <strong>than I did getting a four-year degree</strong> in Internet marketing."</p>
				<p class="bigp">- F. Dahlitz, Marketing Manager, Facebook</p></blockquote>
<br>
<p class="bigp"><blockquote>“I recently worked through the getting press section, resulting in coverage in Marie Claire, The Telegraph, and The Guardian, with no more than 3 hours effort. <strong>Nothing short of magic."</strong></p>
				<p class="bigp">- Charlotte Ellis, Vela Flowers</p></blockquote>
<br>
<p class="bigp"><blockquote>“Every investor should buy a copy of this for all of their startups. <strong>And every founder needs it.”</strong></p>
				<p class="bigp">- Alex Dunson, SAATCHinvest</p></blockquote>

			<h2 class="page-header">Most Growth Hacking Books Are Bull****</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<p>Growth hacking books and Internet marketing books are full of useless, high-level advice that will leave you with no idea as to what you should <em>actually</em> do to grow a product or company at the end of the day. It turns out that there's enough money around selling the veneer or consulting that the authors could make a bunch of money without ever giving away the actual <em>secret sauce</em>.</p>
				<p>You'll notice immediately: This book is not like those books.</p>
				<p>Open this book with zero experience in Internet marketing or growth hacking, and you'll walk away knowing a dozen strategies you can actually use to grow a company, service, product, or app. Perhaps more importantly, you'll know <em>exactly</em> what the steps are to actually doing that.</p>
				<p><strong>The truth is growth hacking just isn't that hard once someone tells you how to do it. It's just that no one ever has</strong>.</p>

					<p>The proof, as they say, is in the pudding. Early backers of our Kickstarter campaign watched as we used the growth hacking tactics in the book to <em>sell the book itself</em>. Because Kickstarter and Indiegogo revenue numbers are public, anyone can verify that we used the methods in this growth hacking book to pre-sell $110,000 of a book that didn't exist yet. This stuff is powerful.</p>
